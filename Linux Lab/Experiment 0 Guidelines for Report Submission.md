# Experiment 0: Guidelines for Linux Lab Report Submission

**Course:** Linux Shell Scripting Lab
**Objective:** To learn the correct method for preparing and submitting lab reports. This ensures you have performed the practical work yourself and allows for efficient grading.

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Linux Shell Scripting lab. The purpose of these labs is to build hands-on, practical skills. To verify your participation and understanding, you are required to submit a report for each experiment.

This experiment (Experiment 0) will guide you on **how** to create and submit these reports. You will be using the `script` command to record your work and the Markdown format (`.md` files) to present it.

## 2. Why Markdown and Not Screenshots?

Using Markdown files over screenshots is a requirement for this course. The reasons are:

*   **Authenticity:** It is very difficult to fake a terminal session recorded by the `script` command. Screenshots can be easily edited or shared.
*   **Understanding:** You must explain your process, which proves you understood the task, rather than just copying commands.
*   **Professionalism:** Markdown is the standard for documentation on platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Learning it is a valuable skill.
*   **Efficiency:** Text-based reports are easier for the instructor to review, grade, and provide feedback on.

## 3. Step-by-Step Procedure

### **Step 1: Record Your Session with `script`**

1.  Open your terminal at the **beginning** of your lab session.
2.  Start a recording session by typing:
   

```bash
script -a lab_session_[EXPERIMENT_NUMBER].md
```
    **Example:**

```bash
script -a lab_session_1.md
```

    *   The `-a` flag means "append". This allows you to start and stop the script command without losing previous work.
    *   Everything you type and everything the terminal outputs from now on will be saved to this file.

1.  **Perform all the lab exercises** as you normally would.

2.  When you have completed **all** tasks, type `exit` to stop the recording.
3.  
```bash
exit
```
    This will save the session log and return you to your normal shell.

### **Step 2: Create Your Formal Lab Report**

The raw `script` output is messy. You must now create a clean, well-structured report using the template below.

1.  Open a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`, or VSCode).
2.  Create a new file named `lab_report_[EXPERIMENT_NUMBER].md`.
3.  Use the following template to structure your report.

## **Lab Report Template**

Copy and use this template for every submission.


<h2>Experiment [X]: [Experiment Title]</h2><p><strong>Name:</strong> Your Name
<strong>Roll No.:</strong> Your Roll Number
<strong>Date:</strong> YYYY-MM-DD</p><h3>Aim</h3><p>[Write a brief statement about the purpose of the experiment. For example: "To understand and implement the use of for and while loops in shell scripting."]</p><h3>Requirements</h3><p>[List any software, tools, or pre-requisites needed. For example: "A Linux machine with bash shell."]</p><h3>Theory</h3><p>[Provide a 2-3 line brief theoretical background of the concept being tested. This shows you understand the 'why' behind the exercise.]</p><h3>Procedure & Observations</h3><h4>Exercise 1: [Task Name]</h4><p><strong>Task Statement:</strong> [Paste the exact task given in the lab manual here.]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> [In your own words, explain the approach you took to solve the task. What command did you use and why?]</p><p><strong>Command(s):</strong></p><pre><code class="bash, language-bash,code-block">[Paste the final, correct command or script you wrote here.]
</code></pre>


<p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code class=", language-,code-block">[Paste the exact output generated by your command here.]
</code></pre>


<h4>Exercise 2: [Task Name]</h4><p><strong>Task Statement:</strong> [Paste the task given in the lab manual.]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> [Explain your approach.]</p><p><strong>Command(s):</strong></p><pre><code class="bash, language-bash,code-block">[Paste your command/script here.]
</code></pre>


<p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code class=", language-,code-block">[Paste your output here.]
</code></pre>
<p>[Repeat the structure for all exercises.]</p><h3>Result</h3><p>[State the final outcome of the experiment. For example: "The exercises were successfully completed. The for and while loops were implemented to iterate through lists and conditions."]</p><h3>Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes</h3><ul><li><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> [Describe any error you encountered and how you fixed it. For example: "The loop was running infinitely because the condition was incorrect. I fixed it by updating the variable inside the loop."]</li><li><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> [Another challenge, if any.]</li><li><strong>Learning:</strong> [What new concept or command did you learn?]</li></ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>[Write a brief summary of what you accomplished in the lab and how it connects to the course concepts.]</p>

## 4. Submission Instructions

For every lab, you will submit **two files**:

1.  **The Formal Report:** Your cleaned-up, well-formatted file following the template.
    *   **Filename:** `[Your_Roll_Number]_Exp_[X]_Report.md`
    *   Example: `B07XX123_Exp_1_Report.md`

2.  **The Script Log as Proof:** The original, raw output file generated by the `script` command.
    *   **Filename:** `[Your_Roll_Number]_Exp_[X]_ScriptLog.md`
    *   Example: `B07XX123_Exp_1_ScriptLog.md`

**Submit both files to the assigned platform (e.g., LMS, Google Classroom) by the deadline.** The log file will be used to verify the work in your formal report.

*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__

* Bullet list item
* Another item

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

`single_line command` for inline code.

```bash
# For code blocks
echo "Hello, World!"
ls -l
