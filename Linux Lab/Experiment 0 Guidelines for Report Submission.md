**Course:** Linux Shell Scripting Lab
**Objective:** To learn the correct method for preparing and submitting lab reports. This ensures you have performed the practical work yourself and allows for efficient grading.

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Linux Shell Scripting lab. The purpose of these labs is to build hands-on, practical skills. To verify your participation and understanding, you are required to submit a report for each experiment.

This experiment (Experiment 0) will guide you on **how** to create and submit these reports. You will be using the `script` command to record your work and the Markdown format (`.md` files) to present it.

## 2. Why Markdown and Not Screenshots?

Using Markdown files over screenshots is a requirement for this course. The reasons are:

*   **Authenticity:** It is very difficult to fake a terminal session recorded by the `script` command. Screenshots can be easily edited or shared.
*   **Understanding:** You must explain your process, which proves you understood the task, rather than just copying commands.
*   **Professionalism:** Markdown is the standard for documentation on platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Learning it is a valuable skill.
*   **Efficiency:** Text-based reports are easier for the instructor to review, grade, and provide feedback on.

## 3. Step-by-Step Procedure

### **Step 1: Record Your Session with `script`**

1.  Open your terminal at the **beginning** of your lab session.
2.  Start a recording session by typing:
    ```bash
    script -a lab_session_[EXPERIMENT_NUMBER].md
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```bash
    script -a lab_session_1.md
    ```
    *   The `-a` flag means "append". This allows you to start and stop the script command without losing previous work.
    *   Everything you type and everything the terminal outputs from now on will be saved to this file.

3.  **Perform all the lab exercises** as you normally would.

4.  When you have completed **all** tasks, type `exit` to stop the recording.
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    This will save the session log and return you to your normal shell.

### **Step 2: Create Your Formal Lab Report**

The raw `script` output is messy. You must now create a clean, well-structured report using the template below.

1.  Open a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`, or VSCode).
2.  Create a new file named `lab_report_[EXPERIMENT_NUMBER].md`.
3.  Use the following template to structure your report.

## **Lab Report Template**

Copy and use this template for every submission.

```markdown
# Experiment [X]: [Experiment Title]

**Name:** Your Name
**Roll No.:** Your Roll Number
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Aim
[Write a brief statement about the purpose of the experiment. For example: "To understand and implement the use of for and while loops in shell scripting."]

## Requirements
[List any software, tools, or pre-requisites needed. For example: "A Linux machine with bash shell."]

## Theory
[Provide a 2-3 line brief theoretical background of the concept being tested. This shows you understand the 'why' behind the exercise.]

## Procedure & Observations

### Exercise 1: [Task Name]
**Task Statement:** [Paste the exact task given in the lab manual here.]

**Explanation:** [In your own words, explain the approach you took to solve the task. What command did you use and why?]

**Command(s):**
```bash
[Paste the final, correct command or script you wrote here.]
```

**Output:**
```
[Paste the exact output generated by your command here.]
```

### Exercise 2: [Task Name]
**Task Statement:** [Paste the task given in the lab manual.]

**Explanation:** [Explain your approach.]

**Command(s):**
```bash
[Paste your command/script here.]
```

**Output:**
```
[Paste your output here.]
```
[Repeat the structure for all exercises.]

## Result
[State the final outcome of the experiment. For example: "The exercises were successfully completed. The for and while loops were implemented to iterate through lists and conditions."]

## Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes
*   **Challenge 1:** [Describe any error you encountered and how you fixed it. For example: "The loop was running infinitely because the condition was incorrect. I fixed it by updating the variable inside the loop."]
*   **Challenge 2:** [Another challenge, if any.]
*   **Learning:** [What new concept or command did you learn?]

## Conclusion
[Write a brief summary of what you accomplished in the lab and how it connects to the course concepts.]
```

## 4. Submission Instructions

For every lab, you will submit **two files**:

1.  **The Formal Report:** Your cleaned-up, well-formatted file following the template.
    *   **Filename:** `[Your_Roll_Number]_Exp_[X]_Report.md`
    *   Example: `B07XX123_Exp_1_Report.md`

2.  **The Script Log as Proof:** The original, raw output file generated by the `script` command.
    *   **Filename:** `[Your_Roll_Number]_Exp_[X]_ScriptLog.md`
    *   Example: `B07XX123_Exp_1_ScriptLog.md`

**Submit both files to the assigned platform (e.g., LMS, Google Classroom) by the deadline.** The log file will be used to verify the work in your formal report.

## 5. Markdown Quick Reference

Use this simple guide to format your text:

```markdown
# Main Title (H1)
## Section Heading (H2)
### Subsection Heading (H3)

*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__

* Bullet list item
* Another item

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

`single_line command` for inline code.

```bash
# For code blocks
echo "Hello, World!"
ls -l
```
