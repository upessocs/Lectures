# Key Rules for Supplementary Exams, Debarment & Passing a Course

### 1. Supplementary Exam Rules

**Courses registered before July 2023

Supplementary exam carries 100% weightage (the entire course grade depends on this exam).

Students are allowed to take the supplementary exam even if attendance is below 75%.


**Courses registered after July 2023

Supplementary exam weightage is same as End-Term exam weightage for that academic year (usually 30%–50%).

Students debarred for low attendance (below 75%) cannot appear for the supplementary exam.



### 2. Debarment & Options

If a student is debarred due to low attendance, they must reappear for all assessments.

Such students can apply for Directed Reading (DR) or Summer Semester, subject to school policy.

There will be a limit on the number of DR courses a student can take during the entire program to maintain standards.


### 3. Passing Criteria

To pass a course, a student must:

1. Score at least 35 marks (UG) or 40 marks (PG) in the Composite score.
2. Attend and appear in the End-Semester Examination or Jury.

> Failing either condition results in an ‘F’ grade.


## In short:

Old courses (before Jul 2023) → Supplementary exam = 100% weightage, attendance doesn’t matter.

New courses (after Jul 2023) → Supplementary exam = End-Term weightage (30–50%), low attendance = no supplementary option.

Debarred students → Must take DR or Summer Semester and retake all assessments.

Passing needs both minimum marks and presence in the End-Semester/Jury.
