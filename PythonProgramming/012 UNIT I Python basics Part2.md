### 1. **Indenting Requirements**
#### **Usage:** In Python, indentation is crucial as it defines the blocks of code. Unlike many other programming languages, Python uses whitespace (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks instead of curly braces.
#### **Syntax:** 
- Code within the same block should be indented the same amount.
- Typically, 4 spaces are used per indentation level.
- Incorrect indentation will raise an `IndentationError`.

#### **Example:**
```python
if True:
    print("This is inside the if block.")
print("This is outside the if block.")
```

#### **Output:**
```
This is inside the if block.
This is outside the if block.
```

### 2. **The `if` Statement**
#### **Usage:** The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition evaluates to `True`, the block of code under the `if` statement is executed.
#### **Syntax:** 
```python
if condition:
    # code block
```

#### **Example:**
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5.")
```

#### **Output:**
```
x is greater than 5.
```

### 3. **Relational and Logical Operators**
#### **Usage:** 
- **Relational Operators** compare values (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
- **Logical Operators** combine conditional statements (e.g., `and`, `or`, `not`).
#### **Syntax:**
```python
a == b  # Equal to
a != b  # Not equal to
a > b   # Greater than
a < b   # Less than
a >= b  # Greater than or equal to
a <= b  # Less than or equal to
  condition1 and condition2  # True if both conditions are true
condition1 or condition2   # True if at least one condition is true
not condition              # True if condition is false
```

#### **Example:**
```python
a = 10
b = 5
if a > b and b > 0:
    print("Both conditions are true.")
```

#### **Output:**
```
Both conditions are true.
```

### 4. **Bitwise Operators**
#### **Usage:** Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on integers.
#### **Syntax:**
```python
a & b  # Bitwise AND
a | b  # Bitwise OR
a ^ b  # Bitwise XOR
~a     # Bitwise NOT
a << n # Bitwise left shift
a >> n # Bitwise right shift
```

#### **Example:**
```python
a = 6  # (in binary: 110)
b = 3  # (in binary: 011)
print(a & b)  # Bitwise AND
print(a | b)  # Bitwise OR
print(a ^ b)  # Bitwise XOR
print(~a)     # Bitwise NOT
print(a << 1) # Left shift
print(a >> 1) # Right shift
```

#### **Output:**
```
2
7
5
-7
12
3
```

### 5. **The `while` Loop**
#### **Usage:** The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the condition is `True`.
#### **Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

#### **Example:**
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

#### **Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### 6. **`break` and `continue`**
#### **Usage:**
- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately.
- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration.
#### **Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    if some_condition:
   break  # or continue
```

#### **Example (using `break`):**
```python
count = 0
while count < 10:
    if count == 5:
   break
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

#### **Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

#### **Example (using `continue`):**
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
   continue
    print(count)
```

#### **Output:**
```
1
2
4
5
```

### 7. **The `for` Loop**
#### **Usage:** The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.
#### **Syntax:**
```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code block
```

#### **Example:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

#### **Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```
# `in` keyword


The `in` keyword in Python is versatile and is used in different contexts. The two examples you've provided demonstrate two distinct uses of `in`:

### 1. **`in` in a `for` Loop:**
#### **Context:** Iteration over a sequence.
#### **Usage:** In the context of a `for` loop, `in` is used to iterate over elements of a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).
#### **Explanation:** 
- In `for i in range(0, 10)`, the `in` keyword is used to iterate over the sequence generated by `range(0, 10)`, which produces numbers from 0 to 9.
- Each iteration, the variable `i` takes the next value in the sequence, allowing you to perform operations on it within the loop.
#### **Example:**
```python
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)
```
#### **Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

### 2. **`in` as a Membership Operator:**
#### **Context:** Checking for membership.
#### **Usage:** When used outside of loops, `in` is a membership operator. It checks whether a value exists within a sequence or collection, like a string, list, or tuple.
#### **Explanation:** 
- In `"hello" in str1`, the `in` keyword checks if the substring `"hello"` exists within the string `str1`. It returns `True` if `"hello"` is found within `str1`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- This is useful for checking whether a certain value (or substring) is present in a collection.
#### **Example:**
```python
str1 = "hello world"
result = "hello" in str1
print(result)
```
#### **Output:**
```
True
```

### Key Differences:
- **`in` in `for` loop**: Used for iteration. It allows you to loop through each item in a sequence, such as a range of numbers, and execute a block of code for each item.
- **`in` as a membership operator**: Used for checking presence. It allows you to check if an item (like a substring, element in a list, etc.) is present in a collection or sequence, returning a boolean value (`True` or `False`).

In summary, `in` in the `for` loop is for iterating over a sequence, while `in` as a membership operator checks if an element exists within a sequence.
