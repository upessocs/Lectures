**Assignment Title:** Introduction to Python and Basic Syntax

**Instructions:** 
- Answer all questions below.
- Write your Python code in a `.py` file or `.ipynb`
- Include comments in your code to explain your logic.
- push `Assignment1.ipynb` in your git repository and share its url in the form when asked.

#### **Part 1: Introduction to Python**

1. **Python Installation and Execution**
- Install Python on your system (if not already installed).
- Write a Python script that prints your name, course name, and the Python version you're using. 
- Execute the script from the command line and include a screenshot of the output.

2. **Using IDLE**
- Open IDLE and write a Python script that prints "Hello, Python World!".
- Save the script as `hello.py` and execute it using IDLE.

#### **Part 2: Basic Python Syntax**

3. **String Operations**
- Write a Python program that takes a user's first and last name as input and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.
- Use at least two string methods and explain their purpose in the comments.

4. **Numeric Data Types and Conversion Functions**
- Write a Python program that takes an input number from the user, converts it to different numeric data types (integer, float, and complex), and displays the converted values.
- Explain the difference between these data types in comments.

5. **Simple Input and Output**
- Create a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The script should:
- Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
- Calculate the area.
- Display the result using the `print` function.

6. **Using the `format` Method**
- Modify the rectangle area program to format the output so that it displays the area with two decimal places.

7. **The `%` Method and `print` Function**
- Write a Python script that takes three numbers as input and prints their average using the `%` method for string formatting.
- Also, use the `print` function to display a message that states, "The average of the three numbers is: [calculated average]".

#### **Part 3: Language Components**

8. **Control Flow (if Statements and Loops)**
- Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
- Implement a loop that continues to ask the user for a number until they enter 'exit'. 
- Use `break` to exit the loop and `continue` to prompt for a new number if the input is not 'exit'.

9. **Relational and Logical Operators**
- Create a Python script that takes two numbers as input and prints whether both numbers are even, odd, or one of each using relational and logical operators.

10. **For Loop and Bitwise Operators**
#### Write a Python program that takes an integer input and prints its binary, octal, and hexadecimal equivalents using a for loop and bitwise operators.

**Submission Requirements:**
- Ensure that your code is well-commented and follows Python naming conventions.
