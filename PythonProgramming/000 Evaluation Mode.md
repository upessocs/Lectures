# Important Update on Evaluation Format

Dear Students,

Please note that the evaluation for this course has been updated to a *regular examination format* . The weight distribution is as follows:

- Internal Assessment: 50%
- Mid-semester Exam:  20%
- End-semester Exam:  30%

For the mid-semester exam, you will be tested on the *first three units* . I encourage you to prepare not only for *writing programs* but also for *explaining concepts* clearly. _The exam will require you to write programs using pen and paper, so ensure you practice this skill._
