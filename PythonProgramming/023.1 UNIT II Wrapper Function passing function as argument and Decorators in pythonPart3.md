### Wrapper Function

A **wrapper function** is a function that "wraps" another function, typically adding some extra behavior or functionality before and after the original function is called. This is often used to modify or extend the behavior of a function without changing its core implementation.

#### Why Use Wrapper Functions?
- **Code Reusability**: By encapsulating common logic (like timing or logging) in a wrapper function, you can apply this logic to multiple functions without rewriting code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Wrappers help in keeping the core function’s logic clean, while other tasks like validation, debugging, or timing can be handled externally.
- **Functionality Extension**: You can extend the behavior of an existing function (e.g., adding security checks, measuring performance) without modifying it directly.

### Timing a Function Without a Wrapper

Let’s write code to time a function execution without using a wrapper:

```python
import time

# Simple function to simulate work
def do_something(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total

# Timing the function execution
start_time = time.time()
result = do_something(1000000)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Result: {result}")
print(f"Execution Time without Wrapper: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

### Timing a Function With a Wrapper Function

We can create a wrapper function that accepts a function as an argument, times its execution, and then calls the original function:

```python
import time

# Wrapper function to time another function
def timing_wrapper(func, *args, **kwargs):
    start_time = time.time()
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution Time with Wrapper: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
    return result

# Calling do_something using the wrapper
timed_result = timing_wrapper(do_something, 1000000)
print(f"Result: {timed_result}")
```

### Breakdown of Wrapper Function

- `timing_wrapper` accepts a **function** as its first argument (`func`), followed by `*args` (for positional arguments) and `**kwargs` (for keyword arguments). These are passed to the wrapped function (`do_something`).
- The wrapper measures the time taken to execute the function and prints the execution time.

### `*args` and `**kwargs`

#### `*args` (Non-keyworded arguments)
- `*args` allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. It collects all the extra positional arguments in a tuple.
  
Example:
```python
def print_args(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

print_args(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Output: 1 2 3 4
```

#### `**kwargs` (Keyworded arguments)
- `**kwargs` allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments (as key-value pairs) to a function. It collects all keyword arguments in a dictionary.
  
Example:
```python
def print_kwargs(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key} = {value}")

print_kwargs(name="Alice", age=30)  # Output: name = Alice, age = 30
```

#### Using `*args` and `**kwargs` in the Wrapper
They make the wrapper flexible enough to accept any function, regardless of how many arguments it takes or whether they are positional or keyword-based.

### Summary
- **Wrapper Function**: Enhances the behavior of an original function without changing its code.
- **Timing Example**: We used a wrapper to time the function's execution.
- **`*args` and `**kwargs`**: These allow you to pass a flexible number of arguments to functions, making the wrapper versatile.

### Challenge 1: Measuring Execution Time with Wrapper Functions

#### Problem Statement:

You are tasked with creating a function that simulates some work, such as performing a mathematical operation (multiplying numbers), for a given range of values. However, you also need to **measure** how long it takes to run this function using a **wrapper function**. The goal is to learn how to use wrapper functions to **time** other functions' execution.

1. Create a function `count(n)` that simulates work by multiplying each number in a range by 10.
2. Write a wrapper function that **times** the execution of the `count(n)` function and prints the time taken.
3. Test your wrapper by timing the execution of `count(n)` for different values of `n` in a list.

#### Code Template:

```python
import time

def count(n):
    # Write code to perform multiplication of each number in a range
    pass

def wrapper(func, n):
    # Add code to measure the time of function execution
    pass

# Test the wrapper function by passing 'count' with various values of n
ns = [1000, 5000, 10000, 20000]  # List of different values for n
for n in ns:
    wrapper(count, n)
```

#### Considerations:

- How will you measure the time taken by `count(n)` to complete?
- How can the wrapper be made more general to handle different functions?
- What are the benefits of using a wrapper function in this case?

---

### Solution for Challenge 1: Measuring Execution Time

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the challenge:

1. **Create the `count(n)` function**: This function simulates some work by looping over a range from `0` to `n` and multiplying `n` by 10. This will provide a basis for measuring how long it takes to process each `n`.

2. **Create the `wrapper(func, n)` function**:
   - This function will take two arguments: the function to be timed (`func`) and its parameter (`n`).
   - Using `time.time()`, you can store the start time before calling the function and the end time after the function finishes.
   - The time difference will give you the total time taken to execute the function.

#### Complete Solution:

```python
import time

# Function to simulate work
def count(n):
    for i in range(0, n):
        a = i * 10  # Multiply numbers

# Wrapper function to time the execution
def wrapper(func, n):
    start_time = time.time() * 1000000  # Start time in microseconds
    func(n)  # Call the function to time
    end_time = time.time() * 1000000  # End time
    print(f"\n n = {n} Time to execute is {end_time - start_time} microseconds\n")

# Test the wrapper with various values of n
ns = [1000, 5000, 10000, 20000]
for n in ns:
    wrapper(count, n)
```

#### Explanation:

- **The `count(n)` function**: Multiplies numbers from 0 to `n`, simulating some workload.
- **The `wrapper(func, n)` function**: Measures the time before and after the `count(n)` function is executed. The difference is printed as the execution time in microseconds.

This is a basic approach to using wrapper functions for measuring the runtime of other functions. It's particularly useful when you want to track performance and optimize code.

### Challenge 2: Using Decorators to Simplify the Code

#### Problem Statement:

Refactor the previous challenge using a **decorator** instead of explicitly calling the wrapper function. The decorator should automatically wrap the function and measure its execution time whenever the function is called.

1. Create a decorator `@wrapper` that adds timing functionality to any function.
2. Apply this decorator to your `count(n)` function.
3. Test the decorated `count(n)` function and any other function to verify that the decorator works.

#### Code Template:

```python
import time

# Define a decorator that times the execution of any function
def wrapper(func):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Use the decorator for the 'count' function
@wrapper
def count(n):
    # Write code to perform multiplication of each number in a range
    pass

# Call the decorated count function
n = 10000
count(n)
```

#### Considerations:

- How can you pass arguments (`n`) to the decorated function?
- How does using a decorator simplify the code compared to the first challenge?
- Can you apply the same decorator to other functions?

---

### Solution for Challenge 2: Using Decorators

In this solution, we modify the previous program by using a **decorator** instead of calling the wrapper explicitly. This reduces the amount of code repetition and makes it easier to time multiple functions.

1. **Define the `wrapper(func)` decorator**:
   - The decorator is a function that takes another function (`func`) as an argument and wraps it with additional code to time the execution.

2. **Use `@wrapper`**:
   - Instead of calling the wrapper explicitly, you can decorate the `count(n)` function with `@wrapper`. This automatically applies the timing functionality to `count`.

#### Complete Solution:

```python
import time

# Define the decorator
def wrapper(func):
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time() * 1000000  # Start time
        func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the original function
        end_time = time.time() * 1000000  # End time
        print(f"\n n = {args[0]} Time to execute is {end_time - start_time} microseconds\n")
    return wrapped

# Apply the decorator to the 'count' function
@wrapper
def count(n):
    for i in range(0, n):
        a = i * 10  # Simulate work

# Call the decorated function
n = 10000
count(n)

# Apply the decorator to another function
@wrapper
def random_task():
    for i in range(0, 1000000):
        pass  # Simulate some work

random_task()
```

#### Explanation:

- **The `wrapper(func)` decorator**: This is a generalized wrapper that can handle any function, thanks to the use of `*args` and `**kwargs`. It measures the time taken to execute the function and prints the result.
- **The `@wrapper` syntax**: When you use `@wrapper` above a function, it automatically wraps the function with the additional timing functionality.

---

### Key Concepts and Benefits:

1. **Wrapper Functions**: Add additional functionality around an existing function (e.g., timing, logging) without changing the function's core behavior.
2. **Decorators**: Simplify code by automatically applying wrapper functions. This is especially useful when the same functionality (like timing) needs to be applied to multiple functions.
3. **Reusability**: By generalizing the wrapper with `*args` and `**kwargs`, you can apply it to any function, making your code more flexible.
4. **Code Simplification**: Using decorators allows you to focus on writing the core logic of functions (`count`, etc.) while reusing common patterns (like timing) in a clean, readable way.

By using decorators, we reduce the need to explicitly wrap each function and make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Let's go through the solution step by step before using the `@wrapper` decorator. 

> Instead of using `@wrapper`, we will manually apply the returned **wrapped** function to achieve the same result. This will help clarify how decorators work internally before simplifying the code with `@wrapper`.

### Challenge: Measure Execution Time Manually Without Using `@wrapper`

#### Step 1: Define the Wrapper Function

First, we define the **wrapper** function that will return a modified version of the original function. This modified version will include timing functionality. The returned function will act like a wrapper around the original one, but we will call this returned function manually.

```python
import time

# Define the wrapper function
def wrapper(func):
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):  # This is the modified version
        start_time = time.time() * 1000000  # Start time in microseconds
        func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the original function
        end_time = time.time() * 1000000  # End time
        print(f"n = {args[0]} Time to execute is {end_time - start_time} microseconds")
    return wrapped  # Return the modified (wrapped) function
```

#### Explanation:
- **The `wrapper(func)` function**: This takes the original function `func` as input and defines a new `wrapped` function inside. This `wrapped` function adds timing functionality and then calls the original function `func(*args, **kwargs)`.

- **Return the modified function**: The wrapper function does not immediately execute `func`. Instead, it returns `wrapped`, which will be called later.

#### Step 2: Apply the Returned Modified Function Manually

Now, instead of using `@wrapper`, we manually replace the original `count(n)` function with the wrapped version that includes timing.

```python
# Define the original function
def count(n):
    for i in range(0, n):
        a = i * 10  # Simulate some work

# Use the wrapper function to get the modified version
wrapped_count = wrapper(count)  # Manually wrap the count function

# Now, call the modified (wrapped) version of the count function
n = 10000
wrapped_count(n)  # This will measure the time taken for count(n)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Manually wrapping**: Instead of using `@wrapper`, we manually pass the original `count(n)` function to `wrapper(count)`. The `wrapper` function returns the modified `wrapped_count` function, which we call manually.
  
- **Executing the wrapped function**: When `wrapped_count(n)` is called, the wrapped function first measures the time, then calls the original `count(n)`, and finally prints the time taken for execution.

#### Step 3: Test with Multiple Functions

We can use the same approach to time multiple functions. Instead of just `count(n)`, we can manually wrap any other function and time it as well.

```python
# Another function to simulate work
def random_task():
    for i in range(0, 1000000):
        pass  # Simulate some work

# Manually wrap the new function
wrapped_random_task = wrapper(random_task)

# Call the wrapped function to measure its time
wrapped_random_task()  # No arguments required for this function
```

#### Explanation:
- We repeat the same process with the `random_task()` function, which simulates some work with an empty loop.
- Just like `count(n)`, we pass `random_task()` to the `wrapper()` function, get the wrapped version, and then manually call it to measure the execution time.

---

### Complete Solution (Without `@wrapper`):

```python
import time

# Step 1: Define the wrapper function
def wrapper(func):
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time() * 1000000  # Start time in microseconds
        func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the original function
        end_time = time.time() * 1000000  # End time
        print(f"n = {args[0] if args else 'None'} Time to execute is {end_time - start_time} microseconds")
    return wrapped  # Return the modified function

# Step 2: Define the original function
def count(n):
    for i in range(0, n):
        a = i * 10  # Simulate some work

# Step 3: Manually wrap and call the function
wrapped_count = wrapper(count)  # Manually wrap the function
n = 10000
wrapped_count(n)  # Call the wrapped function

# Step 4: Define another function and apply the same wrapping logic
def random_task():
    for i in range(0, 1000000):
        pass  # Simulate some work

wrapped_random_task = wrapper(random_task)  # Wrap the new function
wrapped_random_task()  # Call the wrapped version
```

### Transition to Using `@wrapper`

In this manual approach, we manually applied the `wrapper()` function to wrap and call the original functions. This approach can be repetitive, especially when we have multiple functions. By using the `@wrapper` decorator, we can simplify this process.

---

### Challenge: Using `@wrapper` to Simplify Code

Now that we've manually wrapped functions, let's simplify the code using **decorators**. Instead of manually calling the `wrapper` function every time, we can apply the `@wrapper` decorator directly to the functions.

1. Define the decorator `wrapper`.
2. Apply `@wrapper` to any function that needs to be timed.
3. Call the decorated function as usual, and it will automatically be wrapped with timing functionality.

---

### Final Solution Using `@wrapper`:

```python
import time

# Define the decorator
def wrapper(func):
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time() * 1000000  # Start time in microseconds
        func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the original function
        end_time = time.time() * 1000000  # End time
        print(f"n = {args[0] if args else 'None'} Time to execute is {end_time - start_time} microseconds")
    return wrapped  # Return the modified function

# Apply the decorator to the count function
@wrapper
def count(n):
    for i in range(0, n):
        a = i * 10  # Simulate some work

# Call the decorated function
n = 10000
count(n)  # Automatically timed due to the decorator

# Apply the decorator to another function
@wrapper
def random_task():
    for i in range(0, 1000000):
        pass  # Simulate some work

# Call the decorated function
random_task()  # Automatically timed due to the decorator
```

#### Key Benefits of Using `@wrapper`:

1. **Simplified Code**: The decorator handles the wrapping internally, so there's no need to manually apply the wrapper to each function.
2. **Readability**: Using `@wrapper` makes it clear that the function is being timed, and the code looks cleaner.
3. **Reusability**: The same `@wrapper` decorator can be applied to any function, no matter how many arguments it takes or what it does.

This progression from manually wrapping functions to using decorators shows how decorators simplify repetitive tasks like timing execution, making your code more concise and easier to understand.
