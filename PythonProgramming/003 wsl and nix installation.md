### Step 1: Install WSL on Windows

1. **Enable WSL Feature:**
   - Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and run the following command to enable WSL:
     ```powershell
     wsl --install
	 wsl --install -d ubuntu
     ```
   - This command installs WSL along with the latest Ubuntu distribution by default.

2. **Restart Your Computer:**
   - After the installation is complete, restart your computer if prompted.

3. **Set Up Your Linux Distribution:**
   - After the restart, WSL will automatically launch Ubuntu (or the distribution you installed) to complete the setup.
   - You will be prompted to create a new user account and password for your Linux environment.

4. **Update WSL:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of WSL by running:
     ```powershell
     wsl --update
     ```

5. **Check WSL Version:**
   - Confirm that you’re using WSL 2 (which is more efficient) by running:
     ```powershell
     wsl -l -v
     ```
   - If your installed distribution is using WSL 1, you can upgrade it to WSL 2 with:
     ```powershell
     wsl --set-version <distribution_name> 2
     ```

### Step 2: Install Nix in WSL

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   - Open your WSL terminal (e.g., Ubuntu) and update the package lists:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```

2. **Download and Install Nix:**
   - Run the following command to install Nix:
     ```bash
     curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions. This script will install the Nix package manager and set up your environment.

3. **Source Nix Environment:**
   - After installation, source your shell configuration to load Nix:
     ```bash
     . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can close and reopen your terminal to automatically load the environment.

4. **Test Nix Installation:**
   - Verify that Nix is working by running:
     ```bash
     nix-env --version
     ```
   - You should see the version of Nix installed.

### Optional: Installing a Different Linux Distribution

If you want to install a different Linux distribution, you can do so by selecting one from the Microsoft Store. Search for "Linux" in the store, choose your preferred distribution (e.g., Debian, Kali, etc.), and install it. You can switch between installed distributions using the `wsl` command.

### Notes
- No separate downloads are required other than what’s provided via the commands above.
- Ensure your system is up-to-date for a smoother installation process.
