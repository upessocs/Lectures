    "### 1. Distance Between Two Points in 2D Space:\n",
    "In a 2D space, the distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) can be computed using the **Euclidean distance formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula comes from applying the Pythagorean theorem, where the difference in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates form the legs of a right triangle, and the distance is the hypotenuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Distance Between Two Points in 3D Space:\n",
    "In 3D space, the distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2, z_2)\\) extends the 2D concept by incorporating the z-axis. The formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds the third dimension, accounting for the difference along the z-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generalized Distance in nD Space:\n",
    "In an n-dimensional space, points are represented as vectors with \\(n\\) components, \\(\\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2, ..., q_n)\\). The distance between the two points in \\(n\\)-dimensional space is generalized using the Euclidean distance formula as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d = \\sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + ... + (q_n - p_n)^2}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **Euclidean distance** in \\(n\\)-dimensional space and is derived by generalizing the Pythagorean theorem to any number of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hamiltonian (or Hamming) Distance:\n",
    "The **Hamming distance** is used primarily in discrete spaces, such as binary strings, and measures the number of positions at which the corresponding elements of two sequences differ. For two sequences \\(\\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2, ..., q_n)\\), the Hamming distance \\(d_H\\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d_H = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\delta(p_i, q_i)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where \\(\\delta(p_i, q_i)\\) is 0 if \\(p_i = q_i\\), and 1 otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Hamming distance between the binary strings \"1101\" and \"1001\" is 1 (because they differ at the second position).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Euclidean Distance:\n",
    "The **Euclidean distance** between two points is the straight-line distance between them, as described above for 2D, 3D, and \\(n\\)-dimensional spaces. It is a measure of the shortest path between two points in a Euclidean space and can be generalized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d_E = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In physical terms, it measures the \"as-the-crow-flies\" distance between points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Generalized Distance Metrics:\n",
    "There are many ways to measure distance between points beyond the Euclidean distance. The general class of these measures is called **Minkowski distance**, of which Euclidean and Manhattan distances are special cases. The Minkowski distance is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d_M = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |q_i - p_i|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- When \\(p = 2\\), this is the **Euclidean distance**.\n",
    "- When \\(p = 1\\), this is the **Manhattan (or taxicab) distance**, where you sum the absolute differences of the coordinates.\n",
    "- As \\(p \\to \\infty\\), this becomes the **Chebyshev distance**, where the distance is the maximum of the absolute differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Euclidean distance** measures straight-line distance in continuous spaces, applicable in 2D, 3D, or any \\(n\\)-dimensional space.\n",
    "- **Hamming distance** measures the difference between two sequences of equal length by counting differing positions.\n",
    "- **Minkowski distance** generalizes various distance metrics, where \\(p\\) controls the form of the distance measure (Euclidean for \\(p = 2\\), Manhattan for \\(p = 1\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "These distance measures have different applications depending on the problem and the type of space you're working in."
