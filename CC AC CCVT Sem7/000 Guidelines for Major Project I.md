# Semester 7 Major Project Guidelines

> These are generic guidelines and may change.

## Group Formation

- **Group Size:** 2 to 4 members.
- **Inter-Cluster Collaboration:** You may form groups with members from other clusters or departments if necessary (their domain experties are necessary for your project).

## Project Focus

- **Skills Application:** Your project should demonstrate skills acquired during your BTech in Computer Science and Engineering, particularly in areas like DevOps, Cloud Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.
- **Project Type:** Choose a project that aligns with your interests and showcases your technical skills. Examples include developing a cloud-based application, implementing a CI/CD pipeline, or creating a machine learning model.

## Project Phases

### Proposal

- **Title:** Clear and descriptive.
- **Objectives:** Define the main goals and expected outcomes.
- **Scope:** Detail the boundaries of the project.
- **Methodology:** Outline the approach and technologies to be used.
- **Timeline:** Provide a project schedule with milestones.

### Development

- **Design:** Create a design document outlining the system architecture, technologies used, and design decisions.
- **Implementation:** Code the project following best practices. Maintain version control (e.g., using Git).
- **Contribute:** Explore for possibility of patents, copyrights, conference presentation, and/or journal publication or conribute an open source.

### Testing

- **Testing Plan:** Develop a plan for unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
- **Results:** Document the outcomes of testing phases and any issues encountered.

### Documentation

- **User Manual:** Provide instructions for using the system.
- **Technical Documentation:** Include details on system architecture, codebase, and configuration.

### Presentation

- **Slides:** Prepare a concise presentation covering the problem statement, solution, implementation, and results.

## Report Format

- **Structure:** Follow the IEEE template for consistency. The general structure includes:
  - **Title Page:** Project title, authors, affiliation, and date.
  - **Abstract:** A brief summary of the project.
  - **Keywords:** Relevant terms related to your project.
  - **Introduction:** Background, objectives, and problem statement.
  - **Methodology:** Detailed explanation of your approach and technologies used.
  - **Results and Discussion:** Analysis of outcomes and discussions.
  - **Conclusion:** Summarize findings and future work.
  - **References:** Cite all sources using IEEE style.
  - **Appendices:** Include supplementary materials like code snippets, raw data, or additional diagrams.

- **Formatting:** Use the IEEE conference or journal template. Available on the [IEEE Author Center](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/) or through your institution.

## Presentation Guidelines

- **Duration:** Typically 10-15 minutes, followed by a Q&A session.
- **Content:** Focus on key aspects such as the problem statement, solution approach, implementation details, and results.
- **Visuals:** Use clear and concise slides with visual aids like charts and diagrams to support your points.
- **Rehearse:** Practice your presentation multiple times to ensure smooth delivery and to stay within the allotted time.

## Final Deliverables

- **Project Report:** Comprehensive and formatted according to IEEE guidelines.
- **Presentation Slides:** Well-organized and visually appealing.
- **Codebase:** Fully functional and documented code repository.
- **Demonstration:** A working prototype or demo of your project if applicable.

## Resources

- **IEEE Templates:** Available on the [IEEE Author Center](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/) or other academic resources provided by your institution.
- **DevOps Tools:** Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
