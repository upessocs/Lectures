Dear Sir and Ma’am,

This is to inform you, that you have been nominated by your Cluster/School to take one or more courses, in the Directed Reading Program.

We are sharing the updated student list with you as per records.

As per instructions received previously from Pro Vice Chancellor Sir the following details are important and are for your kind and ready reference.

1) For students who are graduating in 2025 or 2026, the marks have to be submitted on or before 31st October and the assessments are expected in a fast-tracked mode. Please refer column “Graduating Year” in the attached and evaluate the students accordingly.

2) For students graduating in 2027 or later, the assessments are to be completed with the regular semester students.

3) The scheduling for these classes, has to be done by the respective faculty members themselves. You can share a Teams Link with the concerned students as per your schedule.

4) It is mandatory to submit Annexure B which I will be sharing shortly over a separate email with all.

Should you have any queries, please reach out to your Cluster Head as first point of contact.


Regards,
Nakul Ahuja
