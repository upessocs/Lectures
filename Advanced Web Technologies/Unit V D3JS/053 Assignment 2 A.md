### Suggestive Hints

## **1. Overview of Object-Oriented Concepts**

### Hints

* Define Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
* Show how JavaScript implements OO (prototypes, ES6 classes).
* Relate to AngularJS controllers/services, Node.js modules, jQuery plugins, D3.js objects, MongoDB documents.



## **2. Object Model of ODMG**

### Hints

* Explain OID, attributes, relationships, collections.
* Compare ODMG model with MongoDB's document model.
* Explain how Node.js + Mongoose map objects to documents.



## **3. Object Definition Language (ODL)**

### Hints

* Describe ODL structure (interfaces, attributes, relationships).
* Compare ODL with Mongoose schemas in Node.js.
* Relate ODL to TypeScript interfaces in AngularJS.



## **4. Object Query Language (OQL)**

### Hints

* Explain OQL syntax and purpose.
* Compare OQL with MongoDB queries.
* Relate OQL-style filtering to jQuery/Angular/Node array filters and D3.js data filters.



## **5. Object Database Conceptual Design**

### Hints

* Explain object identification, attributes, relationships.
* Use a real-life example (e-commerce).
* Map conceptual objects to MongoDB collections and Angular models.



## **6. Distributed Database Concepts**

### Hints

* Define distributed databases and their goals.
* Discuss transparency, reliability, scalability.
* Relate to distributed MongoDB clusters accessed by Node.js/Angular apps.



## **7. Data Fragmentation**

### Hints

* Explain horizontal, vertical, and mixed fragmentation.
* Compare fragmentation with MongoDB sharding.
* Provide region-based data distribution examples.



## **8. Replication**

### Hints

* Explain synchronous/async replication and replica sets.
* Relate to MongoDB’s primary–secondary replication and Node.js automatic reconnection.
* Show how replication ensures uninterrupted service for Angular/jQuery users.



## **9. Allocation Techniques**

### Hints

* Define centralized, partitioned, replicated, and mixed allocation.
* Explain latency, frequency, cost factors.
* Relate to cloud DB region selection and MongoDB Atlas cluster design.



## **10. Types of Distributed Database Systems**

### Hints

* Explain homogeneous, heterogeneous, federated DB systems.
* Relate to Node.js microservices using multiple databases (MongoDB + SQL + Redis).
* Show how Angular front-ends interact through unified APIs.



## **11. Query Processing in Distributed Databases**

### Hints

* Describe parsing, optimization, execution, merging of results.
* Explain query shipping vs data shipping.
* Relate to MongoDB sharded query routing and Node.js API consolidation.



## **12. Concurrency Control in Distributed Databases**

### Hints

* Explain 2PL, timestamp ordering, and optimistic methods.
* Relate to MongoDB’s document-level locking.
* Mention concurrent requests handled by Node.js backends.



## **13. Recovery Techniques in Distributed Databases**

### Hints

* Explain logging, checkpoints, roll-forward/rollback, failover.
* Relate to MongoDB replica set failover and oplog recovery.
* Show how Node.js reconnects during recovery without affecting the front-end.
