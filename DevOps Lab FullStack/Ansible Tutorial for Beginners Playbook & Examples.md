# Ansible Tutorial for Beginners: Playbook & Examples
Ansible is software that enables cross-platform automation and orchestration at scale and has become the standard choice among enterprise automation solutions. 

It’s mostly addressed to IT operators, administrators, and decision-makers, helping them achieve operational excellence across their entire infrastructure ecosystem.

Backed by RedHat and a loyal open-source community, it is considered an excellent option for configuration management, infrastructure provisioning, and application deployment use cases. 

Its automation opportunities are endless across hybrid clouds, on-prem infrastructure, and IoT and it’s an engine that can greatly improve the efficiency and consistency of your IT environments.

Ready to automate everything? Let’s go!

### How does Ansible work?

Ansible uses the concepts of control and managed nodes. It connects from the **control node**, any machine with Ansible installed, to the **managed nodes** sending commands and instructions to them.

The units of code that Ansible executes on the managed nodes are called **modules**. Each module is invoked by a **task**, and an ordered list of tasks together forms a **playbook.** Users write playbooks with tasks and modules to define the desired state of the system.

The managed machines are represented in a simplistic **inventory** file that groups all the nodes into different categories.

Ansible leverages a very simple language, [YAML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html), to define playbooks in a human-readable data format that is really easy to understand from day one.

Even more, Ansible doesn’t require the installation of any extra agents on the managed nodes so it’s simple to start using it.

Typically, the only thing a user needs is a terminal to execute Ansible commands and a text editor to define the configuration files.

### Benefits of using Ansible

*   A free and open-source community project with a huge audience.
*   Battle-tested over many years as the preferred tool of IT wizards.
*   Easy to start and use from day one, without the need for any special coding skills.
*   Simple deployment workflow without any extra agents.
*   Includes some sophisticated features around modularity and reusability that come in handy as users become more proficient.
*   Extensive and comprehensive official documentation that is complemented by a plethora of online material produced by its community.

To sum up, Ansible is simple yet powerful, agentless, community-powered, predictable, and secure.
