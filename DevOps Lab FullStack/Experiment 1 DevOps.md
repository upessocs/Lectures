### **Theory:**  
**DevOps** is a culture and set of practices that bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its primary goal is to improve collaboration, automate processes, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software.  

#### **Core Principles of DevOps:**  
1. **Collaboration**: Fostering communication between development and operations teams.  
2. **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks like testing, integration, and deployment.  
3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically merging and testing code changes.  
4. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Ensuring the application is always ready for deployment.  
5. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuously tracking performance and incorporating feedback.  

#### **Significance of DevOps in Modern Software Development:**  
1. **Faster Development Cycles**: Reduces time-to-market.  
2. **Improved Quality**: Detects and resolves issues early through automated testing.  
3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Aligns team goals, reducing silos.  
4. **Scalability**: Supports scalable and reliable software delivery pipelines.

### **Apparatus/Software Required:**  
1. **DevOps Tools**:  
- Git (Version Control System)  
- Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD (CI/CD Pipeline)  
- Docker (Containerization)  
2. **Sample Code Repository**: A sample project hosted on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.  
3. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IntelliJ.  
4. **Operating System**: Windows/Linux/MacOS.  

---

### **Procedure:**  
1. **Understand DevOps Principles**:  
a. Research the core principles of DevOps.  
b. Discuss real-world scenarios where DevOps practices are applied.  

2. **Set Up Version Control (Git)**:  
a. Install Git and configure it with your username and email.  
b. Clone a sample code repository from GitHub/GitLab.  

3. **Explore Continuous Integration (CI)**:  
a. Open the sample project and make a small code change.  
b. Push the changes to the remote repository.  
c. Observe the CI pipeline triggering and running automated tests.  

4. **Understand Continuous Delivery (CD)**:  
a. Configure the pipeline to deploy the code to a staging environment.  
b. Observe the deployment process and verify the application.  

5. **Explore Automation with Docker**:  
a. Install Docker and create a Dockerfile for the sample application.  
b. Build a Docker image and run the application in a container.  

6. **Monitor and Analyze**:  
a. Use logs or monitoring tools to analyze application performance.  
b. Document any issues and the feedback process.

### **Observations:**  
1. Note the steps involved in automating the CI/CD pipeline.  
2. Observe the time taken for deployment before and after automation.  
3. Document any errors and how the tools helped resolve them.  

---

### **Result:**  
The experiment successfully demonstrated the core principles of DevOps, its significance, and the usage of DevOps tools like Git, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker in modern software development.  

---

### **Questions for Review:**  
1. What are the key principles of DevOps?  
2. How does DevOps improve collaboration and software delivery?  
3. What is the role of CI/CD in DevOps, and how did you implement it?  
4. Explain how Docker helps in containerizing applications.
