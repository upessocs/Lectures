**[SUGGESTIONS FOR FACULTY]**

- Faculty should keep track of the students with low attendance and counsel them regularly.
- The course coordinator will arrange to communicate the short attendance (as per UPES policy) cases to the students and their parents monthly.
- Topics covered in each class should be recorded in the table of RECORD OF CLASS TEACHING (Suggested Format).
- Internal assessment marks should be communicated to the students twice in a semester.
- The file will be audited by respective IQAC members for theory as well as for lab as per schedule.
- The faculty is required to maintain these files for a period of at least three years.
- This register should be handed over to the head of department, whenever the faculty member goes on long leave or leaves the Colleges/University.
- For labs, continuous evaluation format (break-up given in the guidelines for result preparation in the same file) should be followed.
- The department should monitor the actual execution of the components of continuous lab evaluation regularly.
- Instructor should maintain record of experiments conducted by the students in the lab weekly.
- Instructor should promote students for self-study and to make concept diary, due weightage in the internal should be given under faculty assessment for the same.
- Course outcome assessment: To assess the fulfilment of course outcomes two different approaches have been decided. Degree of fulfillment of course outcomes will be assessed in different ways through direct assessment and indirect assessment. In Direct Assessment, it is measured through quizzes, tests, assignment, Mid-term and/or End-term examinations. It is suggested that each examination is designed in such a way that it can address one or two outcomes (depending upon the course completion). Indirect assessment is done through the student survey which needs to be designed by the faculty (sample format is given below) and it shall be conducted towards the end of course completion. The evaluation of the achievement of the Course Outcomes shall be done by analyzing the inputs received through Direct and Indirect Assessments and then corrective actions suggested for further improvement.
- At the completion of the course, course attainment and other documents should be shared with the program coordinator for computation of Program attainment.
- At the completion of the course Faculty members are suggested to share the innovative teaching techniques along with the course plan (format provided by IQAC).
- Faculties are encouraged to share the master/expert classes evidence (as per the event report format)
- Faculties are also encouraged to include MOOCs, SWAYAM any other online content and share the evidence of MOOCs courses /online courses referred (as per the event report format).
- Faculties are encouraged to share the evidence related to interventions or initiatives focusing the unique/slow and Fast Leaners along with Course Completion files.

**[INDIRECT ASSESSMENT]**

**Sample format for Indirect Assessment of Course outcomes:**

NAME: ___________________
*ENROLLMENT NO*: ___________________
SAP ID: ___________________
COURSE: ___________________
PROGRAM: ___________________

Please rate the following aspects of course outcomes of _________________________.

Use the scale 1-3 (3 - High level of attainment, 2 - Moderate level of attainment, 1 - Low level of attainment)

| Course Outcomes | Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|-----------------|-----------|---|---|---|
| CO1 | **Explain** the fundamentals of containerization, virtualization, and DevOps principles, including their architecture, concepts, and role in modern software development. | | | |
