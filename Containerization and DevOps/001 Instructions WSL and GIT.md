# GitHub Repository Submission Instructions

All students must properly structure their GitHub repository and GitHub Pages before submission.

> Commit history will also be reviewed in evaluation

# Part 1: Repository & Hosted Link Requirements

## 1. Hosted URL Format

Your project must be hosted using GitHub Pages.

The hosted URL must be in this format:

```
https://username.github.io/repository-name/
```

Example:

```
https://rahul123.github.io/webproject/
```

---

## 2. Add Repository URL on Hosted Page

You must display your GitHub Repository URL clearly at the bottom of your hosted webpage.

Add the following section at the bottom of your `README.md`:

```markdown

## Repository Information

Repository URL: https://github.com/username/repository-name  
Hosted URL: https://username.github.io/repository-name/
```

Replace:

* `username` with your GitHub username
* `repository-name` with your actual repository name

After committing, verify that:

* The hosted page is working.
* The repository URL is visible on the hosted site.

Submissions without visible repository URL on the hosted page will not be evaluated.

```
