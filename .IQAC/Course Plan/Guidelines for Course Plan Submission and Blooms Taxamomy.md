Guidelines for Course Plan Submission

Dear Subject Coordinators,

Please ensure the following guidelines are followed when preparing and uploading your Course Plans for the current semester:

**Instructions to Follow Before Uploading:**
1.  The file must be in **PDF format**.
2.  The filename **must begin** with: `YourName_CLUSTER_Course_SemX_CourseCode_CourseName_CoursePlan` (e.g., `JohnDoe_CS_BTech_SemVIII_CSE401_ArtificialIntelligence_CoursePlan.pdf`).
3.  **Course Outcomes (COs)** must be written using **action verbs aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy** (see summary and guide below).
4.  **Program Outcomes (POs) and Program-Specific Outcomes (PSOs)** must be copied exactly from the official [NAKUL Syllabus Repo\Syllabus Booklets 2023](https://gusindia01-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/prateek_gautam_ddn_upes_ac_in/EmU7a2FLiAxOtmAu33geHZ4BO1WIRVP3VY_URFB-nD0Q7Q?e=9CZume).
5.  A **CO-PO mapping table** must be included. Ensure some of the outcomes are mapped as **High (3)**. For **specialization courses (4th year)**, ensure PSOs are mapped.
6.  In the Lecture Delivery Plan, update all **Actual Delivery dates up to 25th August 2025** based on your completed classes.
7. Add your Name and Email on the cover page (add row in the table).

### **Guidance on Key Points:**

*   **Bloom's Taxonomy for COs:** Please use actionable verbs that describe measurable outcomes (e.g., "Design a system...", "Evaluate different algorithms...", "Compare methods..."). Avoid vague verbs like "understand" or "know."
    *   **Quick Guide:** [https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)
*   **PO vs. PSO:**
    *   **POs (Program Outcomes):** Common to all programs in a branch (e.g., common for all B.Tech CSE students). Must be mapped for all courses.
    *   **PSOs (Program Specific Outcomes):** Specific to a specialization (e.g., AI, Full Stack, Data Science). Must be mapped **primarily for 4th-year specialization courses**.



### **Summary of Bloom's Taxonomy for Writing COs**

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for classifying learning objectives by complexity and specificity. Use **action verbs** from the higher levels (Analyze, Evaluate, Create) to demonstrate deeper learning.

| Level & Cognitive Skill | Definition | Example Action Verbs for COs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6. Create** (Highest) | Produce new or original work | design, assemble, construct, formulate, write, propose |
| **5. Evaluate** | Justify a stand or decision | appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, critique |
| **4. Analyze** | Draw connections among ideas | differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish |
| **3. Apply** | Use information in new situations | execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret |
| **2. Understand** | Explain ideas or concepts | classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate |
| **1. Remember** (Lowest) | Recall facts and basic concepts | define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state |

**Key Principle:** Your Course Outcomes (COs) should aim for verbs in the **Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create** levels to push students beyond simple memorization.
