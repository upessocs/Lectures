# [INSTRUCTIONS FOR FACULTY]{.underline} {#instructions-for-faculty .unnumbered}

## Instructions for faculty {#instructions-for-faculty-1 .unnumbered}

##  {#section .unnumbered}

-   Faculty should keep track of the students with low attendance and
    counsel them regularly.

-   Course coordinator will arrange to communicate the short attendance
    (as per UPES policy) cases to the students and their parents
    monthly.

-   Topics covered in each class should be recorded in the table of
    RECORD OF CLASS TEACHING (Suggested Format).

-   Internal assessment marks should be communicated to the students
    twice in a semester.

-   The file will be audited by respective Academic Monitoring and
    Review Committee (AMRC) members for theory as well as for lab as per
    AMRC schedule.

-   The faculty is required to maintain these files for a period of at
    least three years.

-   This register should be handed over to the head of department,
    whenever the faculty member goes on long leave or leaves the
    Colleges/University.

-   For labs, continuous evaluation format (break-up given in the
    guidelines for result preparation in the same file) should be
    followed.

-   Department should monitor the actual execution of the components of
    continuous lab evaluation regularly.

-   Instructor should maintain record of experiments conducted by the
    students in the lab weekly.

-   Instructor should promote students for self-study and to make
    concept diary, due weightage in the internal should be given under
    faculty assessment for the same.

-   Course outcome assessment: To assess the fulfilment of course
    outcomes two different approaches have been decided. Degree of
    fulfillment of course outcomes will be assessed in different ways
    through direct assessment and indirect assessment. In Direct
    Assessment, it is measured through quizzes, tests, assignment,
    Mid-term and/or End-term examinations. It is suggested that each
    examination is designed in such a way that it can address one or two
    outcomes (depending upon the course completion). Indirect assessment
    is done through the student survey which needs to be designed by the
    faculty (sample format is given below) and it shall be conducted
    towards the end of course completion. The evaluation of the
    achievement of the Course Outcomes shall be done by analyzing the
    inputs received through Direct and Indirect Assessments and then
    corrective actions suggested for further improvement.
