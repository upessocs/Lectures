### Question:  
A microprocessor system is designed with a **16 KB memory**. Based on this information, answer the following:  

#### 1. Determine the **size of the address bus** required to access the entire memory.  
#### 2. If the microprocessor has an **8-bit data bus**, explain its impact on memory access.  
#### 3. Design an **ALU** capable of handling basic arithmetic and logical operations suitable for this microprocessor.  
#### 4. Define the **registers** required for general-purpose and special-purpose operations.  

### Solution:  

#### 1. **Address Bus Calculation**:  
- Memory size = 16 KB = **16 Ã— 1024 = 16,384 bytes**  
- Number of addressable locations = **16,384**  
- Address lines required:  
$2^N = 16,384$
Solving for **N**:  
$N = \log_2(16,384) = 14 \text{ bits}$  
**Answer:** The address bus must be **14 bits wide** to address the entire 16 KB memory.

#### 2. **Data Bus Size and Memory Access Impact**:  
- The **8-bit data bus** means data transfer occurs **one byte at a time**.  
- For **16-bit or 32-bit data operations**, multiple memory accesses (fetch cycles) will be required.  

#### 3. **ALU Design**:  
- The ALU should support **8-bit operations** since the data bus is 8-bit.  
- Basic operations include **addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts, and comparisons**.  
- Control unit should support **carry flag, zero flag, sign flag, and overflow flag** for arithmetic operations.

#### 4. **Registers Design**:  
- **General-purpose registers (GPRs):** At least **four 8-bit registers (R0, R1, R2, R3)** for temporary storage.  
- **Accumulator (A):** Special register used for arithmetic and logic operations.  
- **Program Counter (PC):** A **14-bit register** to store memory addresses.  
- **Stack Pointer (SP):** To manage function calls and stack operations.  
- **Instruction Register (IR):** Holds the instruction being executed.  
- **Flags Register (FR):** Stores ALU flags (Zero, Carry, Sign, Overflow).  

This design ensures efficient execution within the given memory and data constraints.
