### **What is Kanban?**
Kanban is a visual workflow management system that helps you visualize work, limit work in progress, and improve efficiency. It originated in Japan (at Toyota) but is now used worldwide in various industries like software development, project management, and personal productivity.

The core principles of Kanban are:
1. **Visualize the workflow**: Make your work visible.
2. **Limit work in progress (WIP)**: Avoid overloading yourself or your team.
3. **Manage and improve flow**: Continuously optimize how work gets done.

### **Dummy Kanban Board**
A Kanban board is divided into columns that represent different stages of your workflow. Here’s a simple example:

```
| Backlog       | To Do         | In Progress   | Done          |
|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| Task 1        | Task 2        | Task 3        | Task 4        |
| Task 5        |               |               |               |
```

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are not yet started.
- **To Do**: Tasks ready to be worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

---

### **Kanban Cards**
Each task is represented by a **Kanban card**. A card typically includes:
- Task name
- Description
- Assignee (who is responsible)
- Due date (if applicable)
- Priority level

Example of a Kanban card:
```
Task: Design homepage
Description: Create wireframes and mockups
Assignee: John
Due: 10/30
Priority: High
```

---

### **How to Move Cards**
1. Start with tasks in the **Backlog**.
2. When you’re ready to work on a task, move it to **To Do**.
3. Once you start working on it, move it to **In Progress**.
4. When the task is completed, move it to **Done**.

Example:
- Move "Task 2" from **To Do** to **In Progress** when you start working on it.
- Move "Task 3" from **In Progress** to **Done** when it’s completed.

### **How to Limit WIP (Work in Progress)**
Limiting WIP is key to avoiding overload and maintaining a smooth workflow. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Set WIP limits for each column**:
- For example, limit the **In Progress** column to 3 tasks at a time.
- If the column reaches the limit, no new tasks can be moved into it until a task is completed and moved to **Done**.

2. **Example WIP limits**:
```
| Backlog       | To Do (WIP: 5) | In Progress (WIP: 3) | Done          |
|:---------------|:----------------|:----------------------|:---------------|
| Task 1        | Task 2         | Task 3               | Task 4        |
| Task 5        | Task 6         | Task 7               |               |
```

- If **In Progress** already has 3 tasks (Task 3, Task 7, and another), you cannot move another task into it until one is completed.

3. **Benefits of WIP limits**:
- Prevents multitasking and bottlenecks.
- Encourages focus and faster completion of tasks.
- Improves flow and efficiency.

### **Steps to Implement Kanban**
1. **Visualize your workflow**: Create a Kanban board with columns representing your process.
2. **Add tasks as cards**: Write down all tasks and place them in the appropriate columns.
3. **Set WIP limits**: Decide how many tasks can be in each column at a time.
4. **Move cards**: Update the board as tasks progress.
5. **Review and improve**: Regularly analyze the board to identify bottlenecks and improve the process.

### **Example Scenario**
Let’s say you’re managing a software project:
1. **Backlog**: "Fix login bug," "Update user documentation," "Add new feature."
2. **To Do**: "Fix login bug," "Update user documentation."
3. **In Progress**: "Add new feature."
4. **Done**: (Empty)

- You start working on "Fix login bug," so you move it to **In Progress**.
- Once it’s done, you move it to **Done**.
- If your WIP limit for **In Progress** is 2, you can start another task only after completing one.

### **Tips for Success**
- Keep your board simple and easy to understand.
- Regularly review your workflow and adjust WIP limits as needed.
- Use colors or labels to categorize tasks (e.g., by priority or type).
- Focus on continuous improvement.
