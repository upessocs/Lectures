# Issue Tracking, DevOps Tools, and Emerging Technologies

---
## 1. Introduction to Issue Tracking and Workflow 

### What is Issue Tracking?

Issue tracking is the process of identifying, recording, managing, and resolving issues (bugs, features, tasks) during software development.

### Use Cases

- Bug tracking
- Feature requests
- Support tickets
- Enhancements
- Technical debt

### Basic Workflow

```
New → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Resolved → Closed
```

### Components

- Status
- Priority
- Severity
- Assignee
- Labels or Tags

---

## 2. Core Features and Functionality Expected by Consumers

### Key Features in Issue Trackers

- Issue creation and assignment
- Priority and severity levels
- Labels/tags
- Comments and discussion threads
- Attachments and screenshots
- Integration with source control (Git)
- Notifications and email alerts
- Kanban boards, roadmaps
- API access for automation

### What Do Stakeholders Want?

- Transparency into project progress
- Real-time updates
- Easy search and filters
- Reporting and analytics
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## 3. Types of Issues and Bug Classification 

### Types of Issues or Bugs

- Functional bugs
- UI/UX bugs
- Performance bugs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Compatibility issues
- Installation/setup issues

### Classification of Software Errors

- Logical errors
- Syntax errors
- Runtime errors
- Resource errors
- Interface errors

### Key Definitions

- **Error**: Human mistake in code or design
- **Fault**: Defective part in software due to an error
- **Bug**: A fault found during testing
- **Defect**: Non-conformance to requirements
- **Failure**: When software doesn't work as intended

## 4. Overview of Popular Issue Trackers

### Open Source Tools

- **Bugzilla**: Email-based, detailed control, used by Mozilla
- **Redmine**: Project + issue tracking with Gantt support
- **GitLab**: Built-in issue tracking, integrated with CI/CD
- **GitHub Issues**: Simple, markdown-based, supports projects
- **YouTrack**: Agile-oriented tracker with smart search

### Proprietary Tools

- **Jira**: Feature-rich, widely used in enterprise teams
- **Azure DevOps Boards**: Integrated with pipelines and repos
- **Trello**: Kanban-style visual tracking, simple workflows

### Comparison Table

| Tool         | Open Source | CI/CD Integration | Workflow Customization | Best Use Case              |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Bugzilla     | Yes         | Low               | Moderate                 | Legacy or minimal teams    |
| Jira         | No          | Extensive         | High                     | Complex enterprise needs   |
| GitLab       | Yes         | Built-in          | Moderate                 | DevOps-focused teams       |
| Trello       | No          | Minimal           | Low                      | Visual, simple task boards |

## 5. Problems with Issue Tracker Proliferation

- Multiple teams using different tools
- Data fragmentation
- Duplication of issues
- Harder integration and migration
- Reduced visibility and collaboration
- Compliance and audit complexity

---

## 6. Workflow Configuration in DevOps Tools

### Importance

- Tracks lifecycle of issues
- Automates state transitions
- Improves reporting and velocity

### Custom Workflow Example (Jira)

- States: Open → In Development → Code Review → QA → Done
- Conditions: Only QA can move to Done
- Triggers: Move to Code Review when PR is raised

### GitLab Workflows

- Custom issue boards
- Milestones and labels
- Issue templates for standardization

## 7. Why DevOps and TOSCA Now

### Why DevOps?

- Shorter delivery cycles
- Continuous feedback
- Enhanced collaboration
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Why TOSCA?

- Standard for cloud-native infrastructure modeling
- Helps define portable deployment blueprints
- Works with orchestration tools (e.g., Ansible, Kubernetes)

### Use Cases

- CI/CD pipeline modeling
- Blueprint deployment across cloud platforms
- Microservices infrastructure definitions

## 8. DevOps with Emerging Technologies
### DevOps and Big Data

- Automate ETL pipelines using GitOps
- Track issues in data processing jobs
- Monitor data quality issues via issue tracking
- Tools: Apache Airflow + GitLab CI

### DevOps and IoT

- Track firmware update bugs
- OTA deployment logs tied to issues
- Monitor device health and log issues automatically
- Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, custom device agents

## 9. Demo and Q&A

### Suggested Demos

- Create and assign a GitLab issue, link to a commit
- Customize Jira workflow with a new status
- Show issue linking in GitHub: issue ↔ pull request
- Search and filter issues in Bugzilla

---

### What Is the Biggest Bug Producer?

- Human error during development
- Miscommunication of requirements
- Complexity of interacting components
- Lack of comprehensive testing
