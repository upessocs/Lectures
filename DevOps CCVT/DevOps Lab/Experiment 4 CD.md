# **Lab Manual**  
#### **Experiment 4**  
**Title:** To explore the concepts and practices of Continuous Deployment (CD) and how they contribute to automated software delivery using CD tools.  

---

### **Objective:**  
1. Understand the concept and importance of Continuous Deployment (CD).  
2. Learn how CD contributes to automated software delivery.  
3. Explore CD tools and set up a basic deployment pipeline for a sample application.  

---

### **Theory:**  
**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is a software engineering approach where every code change that passes the automated testing phase is automatically deployed to the production environment. It extends the practices of Continuous Integration (CI) by ensuring that updates are continuously delivered to end-users without manual intervention.  

#### **Key Concepts of CD:**  
1. **Automation:** Automates the entire deployment process, reducing manual errors.  
2. **Deployment Pipeline:** A sequence of automated steps, including building, testing, and deploying.  
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Ensures consistency and scalability in the deployment process.  
4. **Monitoring and Rollback:** Tracks performance in production and provides rollback options if necessary.  

#### **Benefits of CD:**  
1. **Faster Time-to-Market:** Accelerates the delivery of new features to users.  
2. **Improved Reliability:** Ensures consistent and error-free deployments.  
3. **Enhanced Productivity:** Frees developers from manual deployment tasks.  
4. **Continuous Feedback:** Provides insights into production performance and user behavior.

### **Apparatus/Software Required:**  
1. **CD Tools:**  
- GitHub Actions  
- GitLab CI/CD  
- Jenkins with plugins  
- AWS CodePipeline or Azure DevOps  
2. **Sample Application:** A basic web or console application (e.g., Python Flask, Node.js Express).  
3. **Cloud Platform or Server:** AWS, Azure, GCP, or a local server for deployment.  
4. **Version Control System:** Git.  
5. **Text Editor/IDE:** Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or PyCharm.

### **Procedure:**  
1. **Understand the CD Workflow:**  
a. Study the relationship between CI and CD.  
b. Learn about the tools and services required for CD.  

2. **Set Up the Sample Application:**  
a. Use a basic web application hosted on GitHub/GitLab.  
b. Ensure the application has automated tests and a Dockerfile for containerization.  

3. **Configure the Deployment Pipeline:**  
a. Create a `.github/workflows/cd.yml` or `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.  
b. Define stages such as `build`, `test`, and `deploy`.  
c. Specify deployment targets, e.g., a cloud service or local server.  

4. **Set Up the Deployment Environment:**  
a. Provision a cloud server or container hosting platform (e.g., AWS EC2, Docker Hub).  
b. Use Infrastructure as Code tools (e.g., Terraform or Ansible) for environment setup.  

5. **Trigger the Deployment:**  
a. Push changes to the repository to trigger the pipeline.  
b. Observe the deployment process and verify the application in the target environment.  

6. **Monitor and Validate:**  
a. Use monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Grafana) to check application performance.  
b. Validate successful deployment and rollback mechanisms.

### **Observations:**  
1. Document the steps involved in deploying the application.  
2. Note the time taken for the entire pipeline to complete.  
3. Record issues faced during deployment and their solutions.  

---

### **Result:**  
The experiment successfully demonstrated the concepts and practices of Continuous Deployment (CD) and showcased its role in automated software delivery using CD tools.  

---

### **Questions for Review:**  
1. What is Continuous Deployment (CD), and how does it differ from Continuous Delivery?  
2. What are the key benefits of implementing CD in software development?  
3. How did you configure the deployment pipeline in your experiment?  
4. What challenges did you encounter, and how did you resolve them?
